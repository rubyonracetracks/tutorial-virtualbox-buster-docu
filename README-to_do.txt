GETTING STARTED
1.  Start tmux.  Enter this app's root directory.  Enter the command "sh server.sh".
2.  Open your web browser to the appropriate URL to view your app locally.
3.  Start a second tmux window, and go to this app's root directory. Use this tmux window for entering commands.
4.  Start a Git repository for your new app, and push your new app into that repository.  (NOTE: As of July 2018, I prefer BitBucket.  Unfortunately, many continuous integration services do not support GitLab.)
5.  Deploy this app.  Instructions on doing this are at https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/publishing.  (NOTE: The Netlify way is easier.)
6.  Update the website/package.json file.  More details are provided later in the section below.
7.  Add a continuous integration badge for the build.  (NOTE: As of July 2018, I prefer Semaphore CI, located at https://semaphoreci.com/.)
8.  Enable the search engine in this app.  More details are provided at https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/search.html.
9.  Customize the README.md file and everything else in this app.  View, test, update, and deploy it frequently.

UPDATING PACKAGE.JSON
1.  Start a third tmux window, and go to the "website" directory in this app.  
2.  Enter the command "npm init", and enter your answers to the questions asked.  This updates the website/package.json file.
3.  In the website/package.json file, add a test entry to the scripts section.  Add a comma after the last entry.  After this comma, add the line '"test": "npm run-script build"'.
4.  In addition, you may wish to make other changes, such as the "keywords" parameter.
5.  After you are finished, enter the command "exit" to close this third tmux window.
6.  In the second tmux window, enter the command "sh git_check.sh".  After you see that all tests pass, commit the changes.
