title: "Chapter 6: Booting Up the Virtual Machine"
---

* In the main screen of VirtualBox, select "MXLinux" and click on "Start". This begins the process of booting up MX Linux.
* In the VirtualBox window, select View -> Full-screen Mode. This gives you the full-screen view of MX Linux.

* Read the dialog boxes that appear, and then close them. In a few minutes, you will be in MX Linux.
* If you ever wish to exit full-screen mode, just press the right Ctrl key and "F" key simultaneously.
* If you ever wish to access the VirtualBox menu when you're in full-screen mode, just press the right Ctrl key and the "Home" key simultaneously.
* Once MX Linux Linux has booted up, you can browse the web from it, use LibreOffice, and do many other things you probably routinely do on your host machine. Keep in mind that because you are in live DVD mode, files you save to the virtual machine are NOT saved upon rebooting.
* Your virtual machine display may be smaller than you like.  If that's the case, here's the procedure to adjust it:
  * Move the cursor to the middle of the top of the screen to access the VirtualBox toolbar.
  * Select Machine -> Settings.
  * Click on "Display", and adjust the scale factor to make your virtual machine display the size you wish.  Then press OK to try out the new scale factor.
  * Repeat these steps if you wish to make further adjustments.  Otherwise, move on to the next step.
* To shut down the virtual machine, click on the MX Linux logo at the lower left corner of the screen (analogous to the Start button in Windows).  Click on the light green symbol at the upper right corner of the menu that appears.  Click on the "Shut Down" option.
