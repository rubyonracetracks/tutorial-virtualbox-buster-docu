title: "Chapter 7: Installing SparkyLinux"
---

* Boot up your virtual machine with Sparky Linux, just as you did in the previous chapter.
* Double-click on the "Sparky Installer" icon.  (Use the regular installer, not the advanced installer or online installer.)
* When prompted, select your language, region, time zone, and keyboard.
* When you are in the Partitions section, you will be asked whether you wish to erase the disk (so that it will be used entirely for your new Sparky Linux installation) or to do manual partitioning (useful for dual booting).  Select the option to erase the disk.  Use the default boot loader location (Master Boot Record), and click on "Next".
* Enter your name, username, name of computer, and password.  (You may use "rubyonracetracks" for the computer name.)  Toggle off the option to log in automatically.  Click on "Next" to continue.
* Check the parameters in the summary section.  If they are correct, click on "Next" to continue.
* The installation process will now begin and take several minutes to complete.  How long this takes depends on the speed of your computer.
* After the installation process is completed, click on "Quit".
* Click on Menu -> Logout and select "Shutdown".
