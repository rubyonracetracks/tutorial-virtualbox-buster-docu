title: "Chapter 10: Updating MX Linux"
---

* Boot up the MX Linux virtual machine.
* When prompted, log into your virtual machine.
* After you are logged in, click on the bright green box in the panel near the left edge of the screen.  This takes you into the MX Updater.
* Select both options - the option to automatically answer yes to all upgrade prompts and the option to automatically close the terminal window when the upgrade is complete.
* Click on "Upgrade".  When prompted, enter your root password.
* When the upgrade process is finished, the upgrade window will disappear, and that bright green box that you clicked on earlier will be black.
* Shut down the virtual machine using the same procedure described at the end of Chapter 6.
* Save a snapshot of the current state of your virtual machine.  Use the name "Updated MX Linux".  I recommend adding today's date to the name of this snapshot as well.
* CONGRATULATIONS!  You are now ready to roll with your Linux virtual machine.  If you ever want to or need to return your virtual machine to this state, you can restore this snapshot rather than reinstall MX Linux.
